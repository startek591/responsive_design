There are two types of relative units
- Relative to font-size
 - em and rem (and many other less common ones)
 - em are relative to their  parent's font-size 
 - Font-size is an inherited property, so if you don't delcare it anywhere, it's getting it from the body (or the default, which is normally 16px)
 
- Relative to the viewport
 - vw, vh, vmin, vmax
